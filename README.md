To contain collaborative work on the project for ISC 567, Fall 2014

## Visual Studio Setup

### Visual Studio 2013

If you have Visual Studio 2013, git integration is included. Follow the instructions under the [MSDN article regarding starting from a remote repository](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh850445.aspx#remote). You will be most interested in the section regarding [cloning from a third-party repository](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh850445.aspx#remote_3rd_party_connect_clone).

When prompted for the URL to the third-party service, use https://github.com/eas604/ISC567Fall2014.git .

### Visual Studio 2012

For Visual Studio 2012, you must install [Visual Studio Tools for Git](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/abafc7d6-dcaa-40f4-8a5e-d6724bdb980c).

Once that extension is installed, you should be able to follow the same instructions for Visual Studio 2013.

## Making Local Commits

Anytime you have changed files in the solution, have tested the changes, and are satisfied everything is working, you should make it a habit to `commit` your changes to your local git repository.
